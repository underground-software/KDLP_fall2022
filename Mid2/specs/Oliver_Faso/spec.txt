Write a driver to simulate the experience of ordering food from a drive through.

First you have to pick where you are going to go, then you need to look at the menu and pick what you want. Finally,
you can place an order and as long as you provide enough money to pay for what you want you get it.

Operation:

Open:
 - Initialize an instance of the driver. By default the file should be in restaurant selection mode.

Write:
 - Select a restaurant to order from. Write its name into the driver. If the provided name is not among the supported
   restaurants, an I/O error (EIO) shall be returned.
 - Otherwise, the driver shall enter ordering mode and the menu of the selected restaurant should be viewable upon subsequent reads.
Ioctl:
 - Order an item or go back to veiwing the list of restarants.
 - If the command is IOC_RESTAURANTS (macro with value _IO(0x11, 0)
   - No argument is provided and the driver is returned to restaurant selection mode.
 - If the command is IOC_ORDER(item_nr) (macro with value _IOWR(0x,11 item_nr, int))
   - The item specified by the number within the command value shall be ordered,
   - A pointer to an integer holding the user's money (in cents) shall be passed as an argument
   - If the amount of money is insufficient, an invalid argument error (EINVAL) shall be returned.
   - Otherwise the cost of the item in cents shall be subtracted from the integer whose address is passed.
 - If the command is not one of the above, an invalid argument error (INVALID) shall be returned.

Read:
 - Read either a list of restaurants or a menu for a specific restaurant.
 - If in restaurant selection mode, a list of restaurants shall be provided (the driver must supply at least two options).
   - Each restaurant shall be listed on its own line and the name shall not have any leading or trailing whitespace. e.g.:
```
Wendy's
Taco Bell
```
- If in ordering mode, the menu of that restaurant shall be printed.
 - The menu should start with a line indicating which restaurant the menu is for e.g. "Wendy's menu:"
 - subsequent lines shall list items on the menu one per line.
   - First the number of the item shall be listed in parentheses, then the name shall be written in quotes,
     and finally the price shall be written as two numbers dollars.cents. e.g. (1) "Baconator" 2.99
 - A full menu might look something like:
```
Wendy's menu:
(1) "Baconator"		2.99
(2) "Chili"		1.59
(3) "Vanilla Frosty"	1.59
```
 - Each menu must provide at least 3 items.

Close:
 - Free any resources associated with the open file descriptor.
 - Close the file.
