Overview:

This character device wil allow the easy conversion of hours in the EST timezone to any other timezone within the U.S.
The user can input the hour they wish to convert using ioctl, and then select the taret timezone by writing its name
into the special device file. Reading from the file will provide the equivalent time in that time zone.

Interface:

Open:
 - This system call will initialize an instance of the time zone converter. 
 - The state of the converter associated with the file descriptor returned before other operations are performed
   shall be as if the last hour entered were 12 PM and the last time zone selected was EST.

Ioctl:
 - This system call will allow the user to input the time in the EST time zone they wish to convert.
 - Times between 1 AM and 12 AM can be selected by passing a request of IOC_SET_HOUR_AM (macro with value _IO(0x11,0))
   and the desired hour between 1 and 12 as an argument.
 - Times between 1 PM and 12 PM can be selected by passing a request of IOC_SET_HOUR_PM (macro with value _IO(0x11,1))
   and the desired hour between 1 and 12 as an argument.
 - If the request is not one of the above two values or the argument is not within the range 1 through 12 an
   invalid argument error (EINVAL) shall be returned.

Write:
 - This system call will allow the user to select the time zone they wish to convert to.
 - The user can select among EST, CST, MST, PST, AKST, and HST by writing the abbreviation of their desired time zone into the special device file.
 - If the enterred text is not one of the support abbreviations, an I/O error (EIO) shall be returned.

Read:
 - This system call will allow the user to view the result of their conversion.
 - The hour shall be output in standard 12 hour time with the appropriate label of AM or PM
   written afterwards (e.g. "3 PM", "12 AM")
 - If the provided buffer is too small to hold the full output, it shall be truncated to fit within the provided space.
