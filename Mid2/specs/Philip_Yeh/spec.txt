-caesar_cipher
The purpose of this driver is to create a caesar cipher.
A caesar cipher works by encrypting text by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount to translate your plaintext into an encrypted version of the text.
For instance if your word was "cool" and the shift was 4 the encrypted text would then be "gssp".

-Open
initalize an instance of the driver. The initial shift shall be 4, and there shall be no input or output yet.

-Write
This will write your string into the device.
Only lowercase letters and spaces and the null byte are acceptable. strings containing other
characters shall be rejected with an I/O error (EIO)

-Read
This will read the latest cipher text based on the most recent input string and shift amount.
Each letter should be moved forward in the alphabet by the shift amount. The alphabet wraps back around to A after Z.
The space and null byte shall be left unchanged.
If the provided buffer is too small to fit the full cipher text, it shall be truncated to fit with the provided buffer.

-Close
This will simply close the file and deallocate any driver resources associated with the open file descriptor.

-ioctl
Ioctl will be used to change the shift amount.
This will make the encryption and decryption of the plaintext slightly different.
The command shall be IOC_SET_SHIFT (macro with value _IO(0x11, 0))
The argument shall be a number between 1 - 26 which will be the new shift amount.
If the command isn't IOC_SET_SHIFT or the number argument isn't between 1-26,
an invalid argument error (EINVAL) shall be returned.
