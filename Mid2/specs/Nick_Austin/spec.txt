text_filter
the purpose of this device is to filter text.
when ioctl is called it will set the filter string we will look for in the text.
text can be written into the device, and read will provide a censored version of
the text from write with every character in the filter string replaced by the
character '*'. For example, with the filter word "doug":
write: "doug went to get dougself a backwood"
read: "**** went to get ****self a backwood"

open:
create an instance of the text filter.
shall intialize filter with no input, and no filter yet.

write:
shall set the filter input to the provided string
returns the count of bytes successfully written.

ioctl:
tells the device which substring to filter out.
the command shall be IOC_SET_FILTER (macro with value _IOW(0x11, 0, struct filter))
and the argument shall be a pointer to a filter struct declared as such:

struct filter {
	const char *data;
	size_t length;
};

If the command is not IOC_SET_FILTER an invalid argument error (EINVAL) shall be returned.

read:
returns version of the latest input censored according to the latest filter
calling write between read calls with a new input will apply the previous filter to the new text
calling ioctl between read calls with a new filter will apply the new filter to the previous text
if the text is longer than the count argument, the data returned should be
truncated to fit within the user's buffer.

close:
cleans up any resources associated with the instance of the text filter.
